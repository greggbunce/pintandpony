### Dark Star - Hophead
***Brewed in Partridge Green, West Sussex***

The Dark Star Brewing Company was born in 1994 in the cellar of a pub in Brighton. Now it has a 45 barrel brewhouse in Partridge Green. Out of its 23 beers our favourite is the Hophead. This  pale golden ale has a nice hoppy taste and at 3.8% ABV it is a good beer with a meal or on its own if you are having a few pints. It uses Cascade hops, which the brewery says gives it the floral aroma and elderflower notes.

### Harveys - Sussex Best 
***Brewed in Lewes, East Sussex***

When you think about Sussex beers it is hard not to instantly think about the iconic Harveys.

This family business is the oldest independent brewery in Sussex, with it in the guardianship of seven generations of John Harvey’s descendants since 1790.

Harvey’s Sussex Best Bitter uses a blend of four local hops, water filtered through the Sussex Downs over 30 years, and Harvey’s unique 60 year old yeast strain.

This quintessentially Sussex award-winning 4% ABV beer was first brewed in the 1950s, and has a balance of hops and bitterness we love.

### Brighton Bier - South Coast IPA
***Brewed in Brighton, East Sussex***

This brewery is one of the newer ones on our list, with it only launched in 2011. The beer we have chosen is its South Coast IPA, 5.0% ABV, which has been its signature cast since 2012. It is brewed with Chinook, Ekuanot and Columbus hops which gives it a robust flavour and is very refreshing (plus we even love the tactile feel of the label). The brewery should receive a pat on the back for not only making a great tasting beer, but one that looks good and captures the essence of Brighton.

### Long Man Brewery - Long Blonde
***Brewed in Litlington, East Sussex***

Fast becoming a firm favourite, we have started to see Long Man Brewery more widely available. This is a local beer through and through, with it growing 500 acres of spring malting barley in the farmland surrounding the brewery. Plus, after brewing, spent grain is fed to livestock on the farm, with any surplus composted. The award-winning blonde is a lighter beer and is perfect for drinking outdoors in the summer. The light coloured golden ale has a distinctive hoppy aroma, with a crisp, clean bitterness on the finish. Coming in at 3.8% ABV, it uses Cascade and Brewers Gold hops, which gives it a refreshing taste.

### Hogs Back - Gardener's Tipple
***Brewed in Tongham, Farnham, Surrey***

Not technically a Sussex brewery, but we felt this one was too good to miss out after we came across it during a surprise brewery tour. The Gardener’s Tipple comes in at 4% ABV and is a refreshing, thirst-quenching beer which is great to enjoy outside. It is light amber in colour and has a rounded malty/hoppy palate.

### Arundel Brewery - Sussex IPA
***Brewed in Arundel, West Sussex***

Arundel Brewery has been brewing since 1992 with the aim of creating the most flavoursome beers it can. With 5 of its beers rated No.1 in its categories on the beer review site Untappd, we think it is definitely hitting the mark! We chose the Sussex IPA as our top pick. It's a great traditional pale ale, coming in at 4.5% ABV, combining rich malt flavours with bitter sweet hops resulting in a perfectly balanced pint.

### Langham Brewery - Hip Hop
***Brewed in Lodsworth, West Sussex***

This is another one we discovered on a brewery tour. The brewery was established in 2005 and is based in an 18th century granary barn. It has been going from strength to strength, winning 40 awards for its traditional cask conditioned real ales. Hip Hop is one of its award-winning beers - a classic blonde that has a 4% ABV and is crisp and clean. It is bitter and hoppy, with a dry finish - a refreshing beer to enjoy year round.

### 360 Degree Brewing Company - Sussex Haze
***Brewed in Uckfield, East Sussex***

The brewery’s mission statement chimes with us at The Pint & Pony. It is clear they are passionate about what they do and, importantly, love what they do, making beer for people who enjoy it. It isn’t just the sleek look of the can that first attracted us to Sussex Haze. It sits at 4.5% ABV and is a double dry hopped juicy pale ale, made with Citra and Mosaic hops. The citrus flavours certainly come through and the topical flavours sum up summer drinking for us.

### Gun Brewery - Zamzama
***Brewed in Heathfield, East Sussex***

This brewery only sold its first pint in 2015 and is brewed on an organic mixed farm that sits above its own spring source. Unlike the previous beers we have chosen, this one is a bit more boozy, with a robust flavour. Coming in at 6.5% ABV, it is a modern take on a classic IPA. This full-bodied vegan beer mixes malt flavours with hoppy aromas and is a great accompaniment to spicy food.

### Goldmark beers - Moshpit
***Brewed in Arundel, West Sussex***

Staying on the stronger side, we have chosen this 5.6% ABV ale. This amber IPA has been described as having strong tropical fruit, cactus and cucumber flavours - we will take their word on the cactus front having not eaten one… What we can say is that this is an ale made with Azacca hops and one not to be missed with a unique flavour. The brewery seems to be a one man band, a homebrewer turned pro that started off making beer after being fed up with ‘generic corporate lagers and watery ale at music venues’ - amen to that.
